# GifExpertApp📌
### React project from the Udemy course "React: From Zero to Expert" by Fernando Herrera🚀.

## About the Project🎯 
### GifExpertApp is a React-based web application that allows users to search for GIFs from the Giphy API. Simply type a keyword, and the app will fetch and display related GIFs instantly.

### This project was a great learning experience, helping me to:
✅ Understand and apply React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
✅ Create custom hooks (useFetchGifs) to handle API requests
✅ Improve state management and component organization
✅ Enhance my knowledge of asynchronous data fetching

## Tech Stack🛠️
🔹 React – Component-based UI
🔹 JavaScript (ES6+) – Modern syntax & async/await
🔹 CSS – Basic styling
🔹 Giphy API – Fetching GIFs dynamically
